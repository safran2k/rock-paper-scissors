Rock paper scissors interactive game

An alternative to the classical Rock Paper Scissors game, with identical mechanics but cooler visuals! The element approach (fire, water, grass) was inspired by the Pok√©mon game series! Game plays rounds until first person reaches 5 points, and displays the winner when this happens.
